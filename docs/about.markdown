Hello, I am Bettina. I am currently working as a Postdoctoral Researcher in Computational Neuroscience at [Columbia University](https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/). I am interested in how the brain develops and I am using a combination of mathematical modeling and data analysis to study this question.
